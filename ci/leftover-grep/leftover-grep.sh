# Leftover-marker gate: fail if the CODE introduces debugging/forbidden leftovers.
#
# Catches the classic "oops, left it in" mistakes before they merge:
#   • focused tests        — .only(  / fdescribe / fit(   (silently skip the rest of a suite)
#   • debugger statements  — `debugger;`
#   • stray console logs    — console.log/debug (configurable; warn vs block)
#   • untracked TODOs       — TODO/FIXME WITHOUT an issue reference (TODO(ABC-123) is ok)
#   • merge conflict markers — <<<<<<< / ======= / >>>>>>>
#
# By default it scans only the lines ADDED in the PR diff (so it doesn't punish you for
# pre-existing debt), falling back to a full-tree scan when no base ref is available.
#
# Knobs (env):
#   LEFTOVER_BASE        diff base. Default origin/main -> main -> full-tree scan.
#   LEFTOVER_INCLUDE     ERE of file paths to scan. Default: source-ish extensions.
#   LEFTOVER_EXCLUDE     ERE of paths to skip. Default: vendored/build/lock dirs.
#   TICKET_REGEX         what makes a TODO "tracked". Default: TODO/FIXME followed by
#                        (ABC-123) or (#123) or a URL. Customize for your tracker.
#   ALLOW_CONSOLE        "1" = console.log is a WARNING, not a failure (default: block).
#   LEFTOVER_FULLTREE    "1" = always scan the whole tree, ignore the diff.
#   LEFTOVER_HEAD        head ref/SHA to diff against the base. Default HEAD. Under a
#                        tamper-resistant pull_request_target setup this is the PR head SHA,
#                        fetched as DATA — `git diff` + grep only READ those lines, they
#                        never execute PR code — so the trusted base script still gates.
